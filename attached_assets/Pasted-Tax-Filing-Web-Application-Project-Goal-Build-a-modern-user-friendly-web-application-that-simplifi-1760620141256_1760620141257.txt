Tax Filing Web Application
Project Goal: Build a modern, user-friendly web application that simplifies tax return filing by supporting multiple tax document formats (consolidated 1099-DIV, 1099-INT, 1099-B, mortgage interest statements, W-2s, etc.) with intelligent parsing and automatic Form 1040/8949 generation.
Tech Stack:
•	Frontend: React 18+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling, React Hook Form for form management
•	Backend: Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript
•	Database: PostgreSQL for structured tax data, with Prisma ORM
•	File Processing: pdf-parse for PDF extraction, xlsx for Excel files, csv-parser for CSV
•	Authentication: JWT with OAuth 2.0 support
•	Storage: Local file system initially, with option to upgrade to AWS S3
•	Tax Calculation Engine: Custom logic following IRS Publication 17 and tax brackets
Core Features to Implement:
1.	Multi-Format File Upload System
•	Support PDF, CSV, Excel, and image formats (via OCR)
•	Drag-and-drop interface with file preview
•	Intelligent document type detection (1099-DIV, 1099-INT, 1099-B, W-2, 1098, etc.)
•	Consolidated 1099 parser that separates DIV, INT, and capital gains sections
2.	Data Extraction & Validation
•	OCR integration for scanned documents using Tesseract.js
•	Parse PDFs to extract key fields (proceeds, cost basis, ordinary income, dividends)
•	Detect and flag potential errors (missing cost basis, wash sales, etc.)
•	Smart field mapping that handles various broker formats (Fidelity, E*TRADE, Vanguard)
3.	Tax Form Generation
•	Auto-populate Form 1040 lines 1-37
•	Generate Schedule D for capital gains/losses
•	Create Form 8949 with proper categorization (Box A, B, D, E)
•	Handle RSU/stock option adjustments with supplemental data integration
•	Support Schedule E for rental income/partnerships
•	Calculate Additional Medicare Tax (Form 8959) and Net Investment Income Tax (Form 8960)
4.	Interactive Tax Interview
•	Step-by-step guided workflow for data entry
•	Real-time tax calculation preview
•	Deduction optimizer suggesting HSA, QBI, standard vs itemized
•	Capital loss carryforward tracker
5.	Review & Validation Dashboard
•	Side-by-side comparison of uploaded documents vs extracted data
•	Error/warning flagging system
•	Cost basis adjustment calculator for RSUs with W-2 reconciliation
•	Tax summary with refund/amount owed breakdown
6.	Security & Compliance
•	End-to-end encryption for stored tax documents
•	Multi-factor authentication
•	Session timeout after 15 minutes
•	Audit trail logging
•	GDPR/CCPA compliance with data deletion capability
Initial Implementation Steps:
1.	Set up React + Express project structure with TypeScript
2.	Create file upload component with drag-drop using react-dropzone
3.	Build PDF parser middleware that extracts text from tax documents
4.	Implement document classifier using pattern matching (detect “Form 1099-DIV”, “Form W-2”, etc.)
5.	Design PostgreSQL schema for users, tax_returns, uploaded_documents, and form_data tables
6.	Create API endpoints: `/api/upload`, `/api/parse`, `/api/calculate`, `/api/generate-forms`
7.	Build React components: DocumentUploader, DataReviewTable, Form1040Preview, TaxSummary
8.	Implement tax calculation engine with 2024 tax brackets and standard deductions
9.	Add cost basis adjustment logic for RSU transactions (reading supplemental data)
10.	Create PDF export functionality for completed Form 1040
Special Considerations:
•	RSU/Stock Option Handling: Parse Fidelity-style supplemental information to adjust cost basis from $0 to actual FMV at vest, preventing double taxation
•	Consolidated 1099 Processing: Split single PDF into multiple form types by detecting section headers
•	Wash Sale Detection: Flag transactions within 30-day windows with same security
•	State Tax Support: Design modular architecture to add state return calculations later
